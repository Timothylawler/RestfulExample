Restful Example

This repository contains three applications, a web page - /www - written in HTML/JavaScript, a desktop client - /Desktop - written in Java and a REST server - /server - written in Node JS using Express and MySql.

The web page consumes two REST api's using Ajax. Open Weather Maps API and the self made REST api located at /server.
The Desktop client acts as a administrator application for the REST API with full access to all of the server's end points using Java.net.
